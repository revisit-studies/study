# Introduction

Welcome to this condition-based demo. This study shows how conditional blocks can be included or skipped based on the URL query parameter. Blocks without a condition are always included; blocks with a matching condition are included.

Try these URLs:
- [/demo-condition?condition=color](../demo-condition?condition=color)
- [/demo-condition?condition=size](../demo-condition?condition=size)
- [/demo-condition?condition=shape](../demo-condition?condition=shape)
- [/demo-condition?condition=color,size](../demo-condition?condition=color,size)
