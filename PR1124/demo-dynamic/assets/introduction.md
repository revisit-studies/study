This is a sample study demonstrating how to create a study page using dynamic blocks.

Make sure to review [the documentation for dynamic blocks](https://revisit.dev/docs/designing-studies/dynamic-blocks/).

In this example, you will complete an HSL color code test by choosing the square with higher saturation.
The difficulty of the next question will adjust based on your correctness on the previous one.
