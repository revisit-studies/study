              agree, however, you must be fully informed about the purpose of
              the study, the procedures to be followed, and any benefits, risks

              participation.

## Purpose of the Study
Visual representations of data (visualizations) are increasingly
common in everyday life. The purpose of this study is to learn
more about how people read and understand visualizations.

## Tasks
The test contains 8 questions about 4 data
visualizations. 
It will take approximately 10-15 minutes to finish this
test. 
For each question, you will be given an interactive data
visualization (right) and a problem to solve (left). 
We suggest maximizing your browser window as some charts can be on the larger side.

## Benefits to research participants and others:
The possible benefits include exposure to interesting data
visualization, along with helping inform the
development of future experiment reporting techniques.
