This is an example study designed to demonstrate how to embed various question types and form elements within the study page. The types included in this study are [dropdown](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/DropdownResponse/), [numerical](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/NumericalResponse/), [Likert](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/LikertResponse/), [matrix](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/MatrixResponse/), [short text](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/ShortTextResponse/), [long text](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/LongTextResponse/), [checkbox](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/CheckboxResponse/), [radio](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/RadioResponse/), [slider](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/SliderResponse/), [ranking widget](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/RankingResponse/) and [buttons](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/ButtonsResponse/).

You'll also see how to randomize the order of options within a question, as well as the order of questions within a form.
