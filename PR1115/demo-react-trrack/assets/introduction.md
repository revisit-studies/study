This is an example project to show how to pass answers from a  React component to the reVISit Framework.
It also shows how to use the Trrack library to track user interactions in React components.

The example is a Stroop color test.
In each trial, you will see a word displayed in a color.
Type the color of the text (not the word itself) in the text input.
For example, if the word RED is shown in blue, type "BLUE."
You can proceed when you have entered a response.
