Markdown components can have responses (e.g. in a consent form), or no responses (e.g. in a help text file). Here's an example with no responses for a simple help text file:

 * The ReactComponent interface is used to define the properties of a react component. This component is used to render react code with certain parameters. These parameters can be used within your react code to render different things.
 *
 * Unlike other types of components, the path for a React component is relative to the `src/public/` folder.
 * Similar to our standard assets, we suggest creating a folder named `src/public/{studyName}/assets` to house all of the React component assets for a particular study.
 * Your React component which you link to in the path must be default exported from its file.
 *
 * React components created this way have a generic prop type passed to the component on render, `<StimulusParams<T>>`, which has the following types.
 *
```ts
{
  parameters: T;
  setAnswer: ({ status, provenanceGraph, answers }: { status: boolean, provenanceGraph?: TrrackedProvenance, answers: Record<string, any> }) => void
}
```
 *
 * parameters is the same object passed in from the ReactComponent type below, allowing you to pass options in from the config to your component.
 * setAnswer is a callback function allowing the creator of the ReactComponent to programmatically set the answer, as well as the provenance graph. This can be useful if you don't use the default answer interface, and instead have something more unique.
 *
 * So, for example, if I had the following ReactComponent in my config
```js
{
  type: 'react-component';
  path: 'my_study/CoolComponent.tsx';
  parameters: {
    name: 'Zach';
    age: 26;
  }
}
```
 *
 * My react component, CoolComponent.tsx, would exist in src/public/my_study/assets, and look something like this
 *
```ts
export default function CoolComponent({ parameters, setAnswer }: StimulusParams<{name: string, age: number}>) {
  // render something
}
```
 *

  "path": "<study-name>/assets/website.html",
}
```

 * To pass a data from the config to the website, you can use the `parameters` field as below:

```js
{
  "type": "website",
  "path": "<study-name>/website.html",
  "parameters": {
    "barData": [0.32, 0.01, 1.2, 1.3, 0.82, 0.4, 0.3]

      "prompt": "Your selected answer:",
      "location": "belowStimulus",
      "type": "reactive"
    }
  ]
}
```
 * In the `website.html` file, by including `revisit-communicate.js`, you can use the `Revisit.onDataReceive` method to retrieve the data, and `Revisit.postAnswers` to send the user's responses back to the reVISit as shown in the example below:

```html
<script src="../../revisitUtilities/revisit-communicate.js"></script>
<script>
  Revisit.onDataReceive((data) => {
    const barData = data['barData'];
    ...
  });

  // Call out that 'barChart' needs to match ID in 'response' object
  Revisit.postAnswers({ barChart: userAnswer });
</script>
```

  * If the html website implements Trrack library for provenance tracking, you can send the provenance graph back to reVISit by calling `Revisit.postProvenanceGraph` as shown in the example below. You need to call this each time the Trrack state is updated so that reVISit is kept aware of the changes in the provenance graph.

```js
const trrack = initializeTrrack({
  initialState,
  registry
});

...
Revisit.postProvenance(trrack.graph.backend);
```

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

/** The ComponentBlock interface is used to define order properties within the sequence. This is used to define the order of components in a study and the skip logic. It supports random assignment of trials using a pure random assignment and a [latin square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square).
 *
 * The pure random assignment is a random assignment with no guarantees. For example, one component _could_ show up in the first position 10 times in a row. However, this situation is unlikely.
 *
 Here's a snippet that shows how to use the random order:
 *
```js
{
  "order": "random",
  "components": [
    "component1",
    "component2",
    "component3"
  ]
}
```
 * This snippet would produce a random order of the components in the sequence array. For example, the resulting sequence array could be :
 *
```js
[
  ["component2", "component3", "component1"],
  ["component1", "component3", "component2"],
  ["component3", "component1", "component2"],
  ...
]
```
 *
 * The latin square assignment is a random assignment with some guarantees. It ensures that each component is shown an equal number of times in each position. Here's a snippet that shows how to use the latin square order:
 *
```js
{
  "order": "latinSquare",
  "components": [
    "component1",
    "component2",
    "component3"
  ]
}
```
 *
 * This snippet would produce a latin square order of the components in the sequence array. Since the latin square guarantees that each component is shown an equal number of times in each position, the resulting sequence array could be:
 *
```js
[
  ["component1", "component2", "component3"],
  ["component2", "component3", "component1"],
  ["component3", "component1", "component2"],
  ...
]
```
 *
 * The fixed assignment is a fixed assignment of components. This is used when you want to show the components in a specific order. Here's a snippet that shows how to use the fixed order:
 *
```js
{
  "order": "fixed",
  "components": [
    "component1",
    "component2",
    "component3"
  ]
}
```
 *
 * This snippet would produce a fixed order of the components in the sequence array. The resulting sequence array would be:
 *
```js
[
  ["component1", "component2", "component3"],
  ["component1", "component2", "component3"],
  ["component1", "component2", "component3"],
  ...
]
```
 *
 * In addition to the order property, the ComponentBlock interface also includes the `"numSamples"` property. This is used to reduce the number of components shown to a participant. This property respects the order property and the guarantees provided by the order property. For example, if you have three components in the components array and you set `"numSamples"` to 2, you would randomize across the three components while only showing a participant two of them. Here's a snippet that shows how to use the numSamples property:
 *
```js
{
  "order": "latinSquare",
  "components": [
    "component1",
    "component2",
    "component3"
  ],
  "numSamples": 2
}
```
 *
 * This snippet would produce a latin square order of the components in the sequence array. Since the latin square guarantees that each component is shown an equal number of times in each position, the resulting sequence array could be:
 *
```js
[
  ["component1", "component2"],
  ["component2", "component3"],
  ["component3", "component1"],
  ...
]
```
 *
 * The interruptions property specifies an array of interruptions. These can be used for breaks or attention checks. Interruptions can be deterministic or random. Please see [InterruptionBlock](../../type-aliases/InterruptionBlock) for more specific information.
 *
 * The skip property is used to define skip conditions. This is used to skip to a different component or block based on the response to a component or the number of correct or incorrect responses in a block. Please see [SkipConditions](../../type-aliases/SkipConditions) for more specific information.
*/
export interface ComponentBlock {
  /** The id of the block. This is used to identify the block in the SkipConditions and is only required if you want to refer to the whole block in the condition.to property. */
  id?: string
  /** The type of order. This can be random (pure random), latinSquare (random with some guarantees), or fixed. */
  order: 'random' | 'latinSquare' | 'fixed';

/** An InheritedComponent is a component that inherits properties from a baseComponent. This is used to avoid repeating properties in components. This also means that components in the baseComponents object can be partially defined, while components in the components object can inherit from them and must be fully defined and include all properties (after potentially merging with a base component). */
export type InheritedComponent = (Partial<IndividualComponent> & { baseComponent: string })

/** The baseComponents is an optional set of components which can help template other components. For example, suppose you have a single HTML file that you want to display to the user several times. Instead of having the same component twice in the `components` list, you can have a single baseComponent with all the information that the two HTML components will share. A great example is showing the same HTML component but with two different questions;

   * Using baseComponents:

```js
"baseComponents": {
  "my-image-component": {
    "instructionLocation": "sidebar",
    "nextButtonLocation": "sidebar",
    "path": "<study-name>/assets/my-image.jpg",
    "response": [
      {
        "id": "my-image-id",
        "options": ["Europe", "Japan", "USA"],
        "prompt": "Your Selected Answer:",
        "type": "dropdown"
      }
    ],
    "type": "image"
  }
}
```
In the above code snippet, we have a single base component which holds the information about the type of component, the path to the image, and the response (which is a dropdown containing three choices). Any component which contains the `"baseComponent":"my-image-component"` key-value pair will inherit each of these properties. Thus, if we have three different questions which have the same choices and are concerning the same image, we can define our components like below:
```js
"components": {
  "q1": {
    "baseComponent": "my-image-component",
    "description": "Choosing section with largest GDP",
    "instruction": "Which region has the largest GDP?"
  },
"q2": {
  "baseComponent": "my-image-component",
  "description": "Choosing section with lowest GDP",
  "instruction": "Which region has the lowest GDP?"
},
"q3": {
  "baseComponent": "my-image-component",
  "description": "Choosing section with highest exports of Wheat",
  "instruction": "Which region had the most Wheat exported in 2022?"
}
}
```
  */
