These are generally used in training tasks or if skip logic is required based on the answer. The answer field is used to define the correct answer to the question. The acceptableLow and acceptableHigh fields are used to define a range of acceptable answers (these are currently only used for training). For example, if the correct answer is 5, and the acceptableLow is 4 and the acceptableHigh is 6, then any answer between 4 and 6 will be considered correct.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the Answer interface to define the correct answer to a question:\n\n```js { \"type\": \"markdown\", \"path\": \"<study-name>/assets/question.md\", \"response\": [  {    \"id\": \"response1\",    \"prompt\": \"What is 2 + 2?\",    \"location\": \"belowStimulus\",    \"type\": \"numerical\"  } ] \"correctAnswer\": [{  \"id\": \"response1\",  \"answer\": 4 }] } ```\n\nIn this example, the correct answer to the question \"What is 2 + 2?\" is 4.

For example, suppose you have a single HTML file that you want to display to the user several times. Instead of having the same component twice in the `components` list, you can have a single baseComponent with all the information that the two HTML components will share. A great example is showing the same HTML component but with two different questions;\n\n Using baseComponents:\n\n```js \"baseComponents\": { \"my-image-component\": { \"instructionLocation\": \"sidebar\", \"nextButtonLocation\": \"sidebar\", \"path\": \"<study-name>/assets/my-image.jpg\", \"response\": [   {     \"id\": \"my-image-id\",     \"options\": [\"Europe\", \"Japan\", \"USA\"],     \"prompt\": \"Your Selected Answer:\",     \"type\": \"dropdown\"   } ], \"type\": \"image\" } } ``` In the above code snippet, we have a single base component which holds the information about the type of component, the path to the image, and the response (which is a dropdown containing three choices). Any component which contains the `\"baseComponent\":\"my-image-component\"` key-value pair will inherit each of these properties. Thus, if we have three different questions which have the same choices and are concerning the same image, we can define our components like below: ```js \"components\": { \"q1\": { \"baseComponent\": \"my-image-component\", \"description\": \"Choosing section with largest GDP\", \"instruction\": \"Which region has the largest GDP?\" }, \"q2\": { \"baseComponent\": \"my-image-component\", \"description\": \"Choosing section with lowest GDP\", \"instruction\": \"Which region has the lowest GDP?\" }, \"q3\": { \"baseComponent\": \"my-image-component\", \"description\": \"Choosing section with highest exports of Wheat\", \"instruction\": \"Which region had the most Wheat exported in 2022?\" } } ```",

      "description": "The ComponentBlock interface is used to define order properties within the sequence. This is used to define the order of components in a study and the skip logic. It supports random assignment of trials using a pure random assignment and a [latin square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square).\n\nThe pure random assignment is a random assignment with no guarantees. For example, one component _could_ show up in the first position 10 times in a row. However, this situation is unlikely.\n\nHere's a snippet that shows how to use the random order:\n\n```js { \"order\": \"random\", \"components\": [ \"component1\", \"component2\", \"component3\" ] } ``` This snippet would produce a random order of the components in the sequence array. For example, the resulting sequence array could be :\n\n```js [ [\"component2\", \"component3\", \"component1\"], [\"component1\", \"component3\", \"component2\"], [\"component3\", \"component1\", \"component2\"], ... ] ```\n\nThe latin square assignment is a random assignment with some guarantees. It ensures that each component is shown an equal number of times in each position. Here's a snippet that shows how to use the latin square order:\n\n```js { \"order\": \"latinSquare\", \"components\": [ \"component1\", \"component2\", \"component3\" ] } ```\n\nThis snippet would produce a latin square order of the components in the sequence array. Since the latin square guarantees that each component is shown an equal number of times in each position, the resulting sequence array could be:\n\n```js [ [\"component1\", \"component2\", \"component3\"], [\"component2\", \"component3\", \"component1\"], [\"component3\", \"component1\", \"component2\"], ... ] ```\n\nThe fixed assignment is a fixed assignment of components. This is used when you want to show the components in a specific order. Here's a snippet that shows how to use the fixed order:\n\n```js { \"order\": \"fixed\", \"components\": [ \"component1\", \"component2\", \"component3\" ] } ```\n\nThis snippet would produce a fixed order of the components in the sequence array. The resulting sequence array would be:\n\n```js [ [\"component1\", \"component2\", \"component3\"], [\"component1\", \"component2\", \"component3\"], [\"component1\", \"component2\", \"component3\"], ... ] ```\n\nIn addition to the order property, the ComponentBlock interface also includes the `\"numSamples\"` property. This is used to reduce the number of components shown to a participant. This property respects the order property and the guarantees provided by the order property. For example, if you have three components in the components array and you set `\"numSamples\"` to 2, you would randomize across the three components while only showing a participant two of them. Here's a snippet that shows how to use the numSamples property:\n\n```js { \"order\": \"latinSquare\", \"components\": [ \"component1\", \"component2\", \"component3\" ], \"numSamples\": 2 } ```\n\nThis snippet would produce a latin square order of the components in the sequence array. Since the latin square guarantees that each component is shown an equal number of times in each position, the resulting sequence array could be:\n\n```js [ [\"component1\", \"component2\"], [\"component2\", \"component3\"], [\"component3\", \"component1\"], ... ] ```\n\nThe interruptions property specifies an array of interruptions. These can be used for breaks or attention checks. Interruptions can be deterministic or random. Please see [InterruptionBlock](../../type-aliases/InterruptionBlock) for more specific information.\n\nThe skip property is used to define skip conditions. This is used to skip to a different component or block based on the response to a component or the number of correct or incorrect responses in a block. Please see [SkipConditions](../../type-aliases/SkipConditions) for more specific information.",

      "description": "The ReactComponent interface is used to define the properties of a react component. This component is used to render react code with certain parameters. These parameters can be used within your react code to render different things.\n\nUnlike other types of components, the path for a React component is relative to the `src/public/` folder. Similar to our standard assets, we suggest creating a folder named `src/public/{studyName}/assets` to house all of the React component assets for a particular study. Your React component which you link to in the path must be default exported from its file.\n\nReact components created this way have a generic prop type passed to the component on render, `<StimulusParams<T>>`, which has the following types.\n\n```ts { parameters: T; setAnswer: ({ status, provenanceGraph, answers }: { status: boolean, provenanceGraph?: TrrackedProvenance, answers: Record<string, any> }) => void } ```\n\nparameters is the same object passed in from the ReactComponent type below, allowing you to pass options in from the config to your component. setAnswer is a callback function allowing the creator of the ReactComponent to programmatically set the answer, as well as the provenance graph. This can be useful if you don't use the default answer interface, and instead have something more unique.\n\nSo, for example, if I had the following ReactComponent in my config ```js { type: 'react-component'; path: 'my_study/CoolComponent.tsx'; parameters: {  name: 'Zach';  age: 26; } } ```\n\nMy react component, CoolComponent.tsx, would exist in src/public/my_study/assets, and look something like this\n\n```ts export default function CoolComponent({ parameters, setAnswer }: StimulusParams<{name: string, age: number}>) { // render something } ```\n\nFor in depth examples, see the following studies, and their associated codebases. https://revisit.dev/study/demo-click-accuracy-test (https://github.com/revisit-studies/study/tree/v2.2.0/src/public/demo-click-accuracy-test/assets) https://revisit.dev/study/example-brush-interactions (https://github.com/revisit-studies/study/tree/v2.2.0/src/public/example-brush-interactions/assets)",
