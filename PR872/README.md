# The Public Folder: Experiment Configs, Stimuli and Resources

Files that are in the `public` folder are exposed on the study website. For technical reasons, all static files (including reVISit configurations) have to be in the public folder. 

If you want to create a new experiment, you should create a new subfolder in this `public` folder that contains your reVISit config.

Example projects that explain basic reVISit functionality are: 

 * [image-demo](image-demo) is the most basic study example that uses images for study stimuli. 
 * [html-input](html-demo) demonstrates how to use a HTML/JS stimulus. 
 * Check out the [deployed study page] for a full list and descriptions of the projects. 

Folders that don't contain an experiment are: 

* `assets` which contains logos, etc. 
* [configs](configs) which contains a reference of the reVISit config
