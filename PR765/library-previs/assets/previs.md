This is an example study of the library `previs`.

PREVis allows you to quickly and reliably measure how readable people find a data visualization. There are 4 individual scales in PREVis, each measuring a particular dimension of perceived readability. This library includes four components, one for each individual scale, as well as a sequence containing all four scales (the full PREVis). 

When using this library, please replace the `vis-example.png` file with your own visualization.
