# Introduction

Welcome to our study. This is a replication of a study by Padilla et al., published in  Frontiers in Psychology, 2021.

## Instructions

The following instructions describe the tasks you will see and how to complete them. If you need to refer to these instructions during the experiment, please click on help at the top of the page.

**Scenario**: Alpacas may need blankets. Assume that
you work at the Red Cross, and your job is to manage
resources for farms in Peru. In previous years, alpacas have
died in Peru from cold temperatures. Alpacas can typically
withstand the cold unless the temperature drops below 32°F.

**Budget**: You are in charge of the Red Cross's blanket
budget, and it is your job to issue blankets to the alpacas
when temperatures fall below 32°F, which will help them
withstand the cold.

**Budget Constraints**: You have a budget for 48 days of
$48,000. Purchasing and delivering blankets to farmers
costs $1,000 (per night). If you fail to issue blankets to the
farmers and the temperature drops below 32°F, it will cost
$6,000 from your budget.

**Task**: In the experiment, you will be shown a nighttime
temperature forecast like the one below. In the forecast, each
dot represents a 1 out of 20 chance the nighttime low will
be that temperature. You will be asked some questions about
this forecast, including if you will issue blankets to the alpacas.
Compensation: Please respond to the best of your ability.
You will receive an extra $0.15 cents for every $1,000 that
you have in your budget at the end of 48 days.
