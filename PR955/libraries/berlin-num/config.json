  "description": "The Berlin Numeracy Test is a psychometrically sound instrument that quickly assesses statistical numeracy and risk literacy. It contains 4 questions. This library contains four components, each is a question from the Berlin Numeracy Test. There are two sequences: a four-item sequence and a single-item sequence. The four-item sequence is the traditional Berlin Numeracy Test and contains all 4 questions. The single-item sequence is the single question version and contains only question 1.",
