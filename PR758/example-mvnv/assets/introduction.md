# Introduction

Welcome to our study. This is a more complex example to show how to embed HTML elements into the study page. In this example, the HTML stimulus is able to communicate with the reVISit study framework to save the clicked answer in the stimulus as the answer in the study provenance.

This study is a replication of a study by Nobre et al. published in Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.

We replicate nearly the whole study here, including training trials, but there currently is no guided training module.
