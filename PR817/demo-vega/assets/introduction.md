# Introduction

This is a demo study that uses stimuli built with [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/). reVISit supports both Vega and [Vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) based stimuli.

Make sure to review [the documentation for vega stimuli](https://revisit.dev/docs/designing-studies/vega-stimulus/).

With Vega, reVISit can also track user interactions. To track interactions, define them using [Signals](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/signals/). 

## Vega Demo 1
The first demo is a basic bar chart with hover interaction to show tooltips. Participants need to click on the chart to answer the question.

## Vega Demo 2
The second demo is a more complex visualization. It uses a movies dataset, participants can select which attributes to use for the scatter plot axis.
