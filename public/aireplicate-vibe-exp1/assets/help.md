## About this study

This study is investigating how people perceive visualizations and make social attributions about their creators. You will be shown several visualizations with text content removed and asked to make judgments about the creators.

## How to participate

1. **Read each question carefully** - The questions ask about your perceptions of the creator's skills, values, and identity
2. **Use the sliders** - For most questions, you'll use sliders to indicate your responses on a scale from 0-100
3. **Select options** - For some questions, you'll choose from multiple choice options
4. **Provide reasoning** - At the end of each trial, explain your reasoning for your answers
5. **Answer honestly** - There are no right or wrong answers; we want your genuine perceptions
