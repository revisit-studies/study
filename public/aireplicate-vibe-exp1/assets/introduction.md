# Quantifying Visualization Vibes (Study 1)

## Welcome to our study!

Thank you for participating in our research study about how people perceive visualizations and their creators. This study investigates whether social attributions about a visualization's creator and context can be elicited through an online survey.

## What you'll do

In this study, you will:

1. **View 5 visualizations** - You'll see a series of message-obscured visualizations (the text/content has been removed to focus on design elements)
2. **Answer questions** - For each visualization, you'll answer 15 questions about your perceptions of the creator's skills, politics, values, and identity
3. **Provide reasoning** - You'll explain your reasoning for your responses

## Study structure

- **Trial 1**: A common visualization that all participants see first
- **Trials 2-5**: Four additional visualizations from a randomly assigned set

## Types of questions

You'll answer questions about:
- **Creator expertise** (graphic design and data analysis skills)
- **Political leaning** (left-leaning vs right-leaning)
- **Value alignment** (whether they share your values)
- **Intent** (inform vs persuade)
- **Trustworthiness**
- **Aesthetic appeal**
- **Creator identity** (individual, organization, education, business, political)
- **Demographics** (generation, gender)
- **Confidence levels** in your responses
- **Your behavior** (would you scroll past or stop to read?)
- **Reasoning** (explanation for your answers)

## Important notes

- There are **no right or wrong answers** - we're interested in your honest perceptions
- The visualizations are message-obscured, so focus on the design elements rather than the content
- Please answer based on your first impressions
- The study should take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete
