# Beauvis: Assessing Aesthetics of Visualizations


This is a demo of the library `beauvis`.

BeauVis is a validated scale for assessing the aesthetic pleasure of visualizations. This library contains three components for the 3-, 4-, and 5-item versions of the BeauVis scale.

The paper recommends to use the 5-item version where it's feasible, but the 3 or 4 item versions can be used when participant time is a concern. When using this library, please replace the `vis-example.png` file with the visualization you want to evaluate.
