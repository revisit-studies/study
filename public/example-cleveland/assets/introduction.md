# Introduction

This is a more complex example to show how to embed React.js components into the study page. In this example, React components are responsible for rendering the stimuli, but the reVISit framework automatically handles answer tracking.

This study is a replication of a graphical perception study by Clevland & McGill 1984 with the Heer & Bostock 2010 extension.
