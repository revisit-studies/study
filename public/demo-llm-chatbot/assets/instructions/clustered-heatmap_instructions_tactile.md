# Clustered Heatmap Tactile Chart Exploration Instructions

Follow these instructions to explore the tactile model of a **clustered heatmap**.

## Step 1: Orienting the Chart

* Locate the **cut corner** at the **top-right** of the board.  
  * Position the chart so this corner remains at the top-right.   
* On the back, there are **two stickers**:  
  * A **smaller square label** near the cut corner contains a **QR code**. Scanning it with your phone will take you to this companion website.  
  * A **larger rectangular label** provides a labeled version of the chart.

## Step 2: Introduction to the Clustered Heatmap

* This tactile model represents a **clustered heatmap** of tabular data.   
* Move your hand to the top-left corner to feel the title: "Clustered Heatmap."  
* Broadly explore the board to get an overview. The chart is located on the right side of the board.  
* This chart type combines a heatmap and dendrograms:  
  * **The Heatmap is** a matrix of squares representing data values through heights.  
  * **The Dendrograms are** Tree-like diagrams positioned above and to the right of the heatmap, showing the similarity between rows and columns.  
* **The data:**   
  * This clustered heatmap visualizes how frequently actors appear in different movie genres.   
  * Similar actors and genres are grouped together. 

## Step 3: Explore the Heatmap

* **Locate the Heatmap:** On the **right side** of the board, find the matrix of squares (the heatmap).  
* **Rows and Columns:**  
  * **Rows represent 5 actors,** labeled in Braille on the left side of each row, from top to bottom:  
    * Dwayne Johnson  
    * Julia Roberts  
    * Tom Hanks  
    * Jennifer Lawrence  
    * Leonardo DiCaprio  
  * **Columns represent 4 movie genres,** labeled in Braille at the bottom of each column using abbreviations, from left to right:  
    * a: Action  
    * d: Drama  
    * c: Comedy  
    * r: Romance  
* **Legend:** On the top-left of the board, below the chart title, find the legend enclosed in a rectangular frame. It explains the column abbreviations.  
* **Squares:**  
  * **Height:** The height of the squares encodes the number  of movies an actor has performed in in a specific genre. High squares indicate many moves, while lower or flat squares indicate fewer or no movies.  
  * **Braille Numbers:** Each square has a Braille number representing its value.  
* **Example Exploration:**   
  * Top row (Dwayne Johnson), the four squares from left to right:  
    * Action: Very high (45 movies). This is the highest square in the whole heatmap, so it is the biggest value.  
    * Drama: Low (10 movies).  
    * Comedy: Medium-high (28 movies).  
    * Romance: Flat (0 movies). This is the smallest value in the heatmap. 

## Step 4: Exploring the Dendrograms

* Dendrograms show hierarchical grouping based on similarity.  
* **Row Dendrogram (Actor Clusters):**  
  * **Locate the Row Dendrogram:** On the right edge of the heatmap, find the tree-like structure.  
  * From the right end of each row of the heatmap, you'll feel a line extending to the right.  
  * These lines connect rows to each other and group together hierarchically.  
  * The more quickly the lines group together, the more similar the two rows are.  
  * Clusters are groups of similar rows with close connections.   
    * This chart shows two main clusters among actors.  
    * **Cluster 1: Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks** (rows 2 and 3 from top):  
      * Trace their lines to see how they connect to each other quickly.  
      * Confirm in the heatmap: Feel the similar height patterns of squares in their rows:  
        * Both are low in Action (column 1 from left).  
        * Both are high in Drama and Comedy (columns 2 and 3).  
        * Both are moderately high in Romance (column 4).  
    * **Cluster 2: Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio** (rows 4 and 5):  
      * Similarly, trace their lines to see how they group quickly.  
      * Confirm in the heatmap: Feel the similar height patterns of squares in their rows:  
        * Both are high in Drama.  
        * Both are low in other genres.  
  * **Outlier:** Rows that deviate from the main clusters are outliers.  
    * This chart shows one outlier among actors.  
    * Dwayne Johnson (row 1):  
      * Trace his line to see how it remains separate for a long time.  
      * Confirm in the heatmap: The pattern in row 1 differs significantly from other rows.  
        * For example, row 1 shows a very high value in Action (column 1), while other rows show low values in this column.  
* **Column Dendrogram (Movie Genre Clusters):**  
  * **Locate the Column Dendrogram** at the top of the heatmap.  
  * Lines extend from each column upwards, clustering genres hierarchically.  
  * Its principle is the same as the row dendrogram, but this time it applies to the genres in the columns.  
  * **Cluster and Outlier:**   
    * The movie genres are clustered incrementally in a step-by-step manner, starting with closely related pairs and gradually incorporating more distinct genres. The tall tree indicates that they are generally not very similar.  
    * **Romance and Comedy (columns 3 and 4 from left):** These two genres group together first, indicating they are the most similar movie genres among the four genres in terms of actor involvement patterns.  
    * **Drama (column 2):** Joins next.  
    * **Action (column 1):** Joins last, being the most distinct genre (outlier).

## Recap

* The heatmap displays values using a matrix of raised squares.  
* The dendrograms reveal similarity between rows and columns.
