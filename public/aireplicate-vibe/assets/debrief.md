## What This Study Was About

This study examined how different types of data visualizations influence our perceptions of the people who created them. Specifically, we were interested in understanding how visual design choices affect judgments about:

- **Creator characteristics** (design skills, data analysis abilities, demographics)
- **Political leanings** and value alignment
- **Trustworthiness** and intentions
- **Aesthetic preferences** and engagement behavior

## Why This Research Matters

Understanding how visual design influences our perceptions is crucial for:
- **Data communicators** who want to present information effectively
- **Social media users** who encounter data visualizations daily
- **Researchers** studying human-computer interaction and visual perception
- **Designers** creating more inclusive and effective visualizations

## Your Contribution

Your responses will help us understand how people interpret visual information and make judgments about creators based on design choices. This research contributes to our understanding of visual communication and its impact on social perception.
