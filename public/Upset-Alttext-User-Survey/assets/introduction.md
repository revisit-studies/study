# Introduction

Welcome to our study!

In this study, you will encounter questions about **data visualizations and equivalent text describing the content** of data visualizations. We will use UpSet plots, a set visualziation technique similar to Venn diagrams as an example. 

Our research aims to **make data visualizations more accessible to people with visual impairments** such as low vision, residual vision, or no vision.  We want to understand whether text can convey equal amounts of informations as a chart. 

We first will introduce what an UpSet plot is, why is it used, how you can interpret an UpSet plot.
