## Title of Research Study: Supporting Data Visualization Literacy
## Introduction
You are being asked to participate in a research study. Before you
              agree, however, you must be fully informed about the purpose of
              the study, the procedures to be followed, and any benefits, risks
              or discomfort that you may experience as a result of your
              participation. This form presents information about the study so
              that you may make a fully informed decision regarding your
              participation.

## Purpose of the Study
Visual representations of data (visualizations) are increasingly common in everyday life.
The purpose of this study is to learn more about how people interpret and understand 
visualizations, especially correlation values.

## Tasks
The study contains 8 sets of up to 50 questions about 2 data visualizations. It will take 
approximately 20-25 minutes to finish this study. For each question, you will be shown 
two visualizations and asked which visualization has a higher correlation value. We sug-
gest maximizing your browser window as some charts can be on the larger side.

## Risks to study participants
Each participant in this study is assigned a random ID for analyses. As such, your par-
ticipation will remain anonymous and your responses will not be used to identify you.


## Benefits to research participants and others:
The possible benefits include exposure to interesting data visualization, along with help-
ing inform the development of future visualization design techniques.

## Record keeping and confidentiality
Records of your participation in this study will be held confidential so far as permitted by
law. However, the study investigators, the sponsor or its designee and, under certain
