Two rankings are displayed on the screen.
Each ranking has items / people of two different groups such as gender (man/woman).

You need to select which of the two rankings is fairer considering both the groups.

At the bottom of each ranking, you have a button to select the ranking of your choice.
After selecting the ranking, you can click "Next" button on the side bar to proceed to
the next task.
