# Introduction

In this demo study, we will ask you to explore a choropleth map of unemployment rates across U.S. states (2020 - [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/home.htm)) and answer the question. To answer, you are required to select states directly on the map.

Your interactions with the map are recorded using [Trrack](https://apps.vdl.sci.utah.edu/trrackjs) and can be replayed in the participant view after you complete the study.
