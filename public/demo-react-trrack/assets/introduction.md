This is an example project to show how to pass answers from React component to reVISit Framework.
It also shows how to use the Trrack library to track user interactions in React components.

The example is an RGB color building task.
You will see a random target color circle at the top.
At the bottom, click red, green, and blue circles to add color counts, and use remove buttons to decrease counts.
Your selected color is shown as the normalized RGB mixture from your current record.
You can proceed when your color record is not empty.
