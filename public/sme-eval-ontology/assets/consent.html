    <h2>Title of Project</h2>
    <p><strong>Developing an Ontology-based Framework for Digital Media Forensics</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>You are invited to participate in a survey that evaluates a proposed Digital Visual Media Forensics Ontology. The
        survey first collects a few background details about your professional experience. You will then be asked to
        give your views on the ontology's:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Organization</strong> – how well its hierarchy and categories are structured</li>
        <li><strong>Completeness</strong> – whether important concepts are missing</li>
        <li><strong>Correctness</strong> – whether any elements are misplaced or inaccurate</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity</strong> – how clear and unambiguous the terminology is</li>
    </ul>
    <p>An interactive viewer lets you explore the ontology in three complementary views while you respond. You will also
        evaluate how useful each view is and comment on potential real-world applications of the ontology.</p>
    <p>Participation is entirely voluntary. If any part of this form or the study is unclear, please contact the
        research team using the e-mail addresses or phone numbers listed at the end of this document.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The goal of this study is to obtain informed feedback from subject-matter experts on the proposed Digital Visual
        Media Forensics Ontology. Your insights will help us identify strengths, gaps, and areas for improvement. The
        aggregated findings will be used to refine the ontology and to guide its future implementation in real-world
        applications.</p>

    <div class="duration-participants">
        <div>
            <h3>Duration</h3>
            <p>We expect the study session to take <strong>45-60 minutes</strong>.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Number of Participants</h3>
            <p>The number of anticipated participants in this survey is <strong>up to 50</strong>.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Procedures</h2>
    <p>If you decide to participate, you will complete an online survey in either Qualtrics or ReVisit that lasts 45-60
        minutes. After electronically agreeing to this consent form, you will:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Answer a brief set of background questions about your professional experience</li>
        <li>Explore the proposed Digital Visual Media Forensics Ontology through an interactive viewer</li>
        <li>Provide feedback on its organization, completeness, correctness, and clarity</li>
        <li>Evaluate the different views presented in the interactive viewer</li>
        <li>Comment on the ontology's future use cases</li>
        <li>Optionally schedule a separate 30-minute video conversation to further discuss your answers</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You may skip any question or exit the survey at any time without penalty. All responses will be de-identified
        before analysis.</p>

    <h2>Possible Risks/Discomforts</h2>
    <p>No personally identifying information will be collected in the survey unless you voluntarily provide your email
        address. We will only use it if we need to follow up with you regarding your answers in the survey. Your email
        addresses will not be linked to the study data.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Important Notice:</strong> For participants who have access to or knowledge of any classified
        information, please keep your answers to the study questions at the <strong>UNCLASSIFIED</strong> level.
    </div>

    <p>Should you experience any discomfort, you have the right to quit the study at any time.</p>

    <h2>Possible Benefits</h2>
    <p>You will not receive any direct personal benefits or compensation for taking part in this study. However, your
        participation may provide several indirect benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your expert feedback will help refine a publicly available Digital Visual Media Forensics Ontology,
            supporting the development of future real-world applications that can be based on this framework</li>
        <li>By shaping a community resource, you contribute to shared standards that can enhance collaboration among
            practitioners, investigators, and researchers</li>
        <li>Upon request, the research team will send you a copy of any resulting publications</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Alternative Procedures</h2>
    <p>If you would rather not complete the online survey, you may instead participate in a video interview (no more
        than an hour) conducted via Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams. The interview will follow the same question
        set as the survey but in a semi-structured, conversational format.</p>
    <p>To choose this option, email or call the research team using the contact information provided at the end of this
        document. There is no penalty for selecting one format over the other.</p>

    <h2>Voluntary Participation</h2>
    <p>Participation in this research study is voluntary. You have the right to decline participation in any or all
        study procedures or quit at any time with no consequence.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, please note that you are not required to answer any questions that you do not feel comfortable
        answering during the course of this study. Brief explanations, however, make your feedback especially valuable.
        If you're willing, we would appreciate a sentence or two wherever the survey invites you to share the reasons
        behind your selections.</p>

    <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>Only Y. Kelly Wu, Saniat Sohrawardi, and Dr. Matthew Wright will have access to all of the data collected from
        participants. Unless you specifically give us written permission to identify you directly, in any publications
        or presentations of our research we will use a coded name instead of your real name and describe your
        organization in a category (e.g. "a large national TV news operation", "a national-level law enforcement agency
        in North America", or "Private university in the U.S.") instead of naming it directly.</p>
    <p>All non-audio data associated with this study will be maintained for 3 years after study procedures are complete
        and will be stored in the ESL Global Cybersecurity Institute at RIT.</p>
    <p>If in the unlikely event, it becomes necessary for the RIT Institutional Review Board to review your research
        records, then Rochester Institute of Technology will protect the confidentiality of those records to the extent
        permitted by law.</p>

    <h2>Contact for Questions</h2>
    <p>You are encouraged to contact us with any questions or concerns that you might have, even after leaving this
        study. Furthermore, we will gladly provide you with a debriefing regarding this form, the program, or the
        research if you desire.</p>
