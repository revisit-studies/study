# Context Setting

Now that you've selected your preferred social media platform, please imagine that you are scrolling through your feed on **{platform_choice}**.

You will be shown a series of data visualizations that might appear in your social media feed. For each image, we'll ask you a series of questions about your perceptions and likely responses.

**Instructions:**
- Look at each image carefully
- Answer all questions based on your first impressions
- There are no right or wrong answers - we're interested in your honest opinions
- Take your time, but don't overthink your responses

**What to expect:**
- You will see 5 different data visualizations (4 from your assigned block plus 1 common stimulus)
- Each visualization will be followed by 15 questions
- The questions will ask about your perceptions of the creator and your likely behavior
- After all visualizations, you'll complete a brief demographic survey
