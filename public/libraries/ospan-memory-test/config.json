  "description": "The NASA-TLX is a widely used subjective workload assessment tool. It consists of six subscales: Mental Demand, Physical Demand, Temporal Demand, Performance, Effort, and Frustration. The NASA-TLX is designed to assess the perceived workload of a task and is commonly used in human factors and ergonomics research. We provide a component of the NASA-TLX itself, and a sequence that includes a source of load evaluation. The source of load evaluation is based on the pairwise weighting procedure described in the NASA-TLX manual.",

  "additionalDescription": "### Source of Workload Evaluation (Pairwise Weighting Procedure)\n\nReference: [NASA TLX manual](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20000021488/downloads/20000021488.pdf) (Section 2.2)\n\nThis step of the NASA-TLX assesses the relative importance of different factors that contribute to a person's experience of workload during a task. Rather than assuming all workload components are equally important, this procedure captures individual differences in how workload is perceived.\n\nParticipants are presented with 15 pairwise comparisons between the six NASA-TLX subscales:\n\n- Mental Demand\n- Physical Demand\n- Temporal Demand\n- Performance\n- Effort\n- Frustration\n\nFor each pair, participants are asked to select the factor that contributed more to their workload experience in the given task.\n\n#### How It Works\nEach chosen subscale earns one point (a \"tally mark\").\n\nAfter 15 comparisons, each subscale has a weight from 0 to 5.\n\nThese weights reflect the participant's personal weighting of each workload dimension.\n\n#### How to Use the Result\nAfter task performance, participants also rate the magnitude (0–100) of each of the six subscales.\n\nFor each subscale:\nAdjusted Score = Raw Rating × Weight\n\nThe overall workload score is calculated by summing all adjusted scores and dividing by 15:\nOverall Workload = Σ(Adjusted Scores) ÷ 15\n\nThis weighted workload score accounts for both perceived intensity and individual prioritization, improving sensitivity and personalization in workload analysis.",
