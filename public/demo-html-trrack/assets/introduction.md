This is an example study to show how to implement the [Trrack library](https://apps.vdl.sci.utah.edu/trrack) for provenance tracking in HTML stimuli. In this example, the number of dots added or removed is tracked and sent back to the reVISit app.

It also demonstrates how to implement undo/redo in a stimulus.
