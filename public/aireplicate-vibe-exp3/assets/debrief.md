## Study Summary

This research investigates how visual design elements alone versus design elements combined with textual content influence social inferences about visualization creators. Your responses will help us understand:

- How people form impressions of creators from visual design alone
- How those impressions change when textual context is added
- The role of design aesthetics, data presentation, and message framing in social judgments

## Next Steps

Your anonymous responses will be analyzed alongside data from other participants to identify meaningful patterns in how people perceive visualization creators.
