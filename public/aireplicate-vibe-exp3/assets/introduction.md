# Quantifying Visualization Vibes: Measuring Socio-Indexicality at Scale

Thank you for participating in this research study. This study investigates how visual design features and textual context influence the social inferences people make about data visualizations.

## What You'll Do

You will be shown multiple data visualizations and asked to make judgments about the people who likely created them. For each visualization, you will see it twice:
1. **First viewing**: The visualization with text/messaging obscured 
2. **Second viewing**: The same visualization with all text revealed

After each view, you will answer the same set of questions about your perceptions of the creators.
