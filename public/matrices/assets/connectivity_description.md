# SECOND KEY CONCEPT: Adjacency Matrices.

Adjacency matrices are a simple and structured way to represent networks or graphs. In our network, we have states (nodes) and fligths (links) that connect them. An adjacency matrix captures this information in a table format, where each cell shows whether there is a link between a pair of nodes, on our case a flight between two states.

Think of an adjacency matrix like a table:

- The **rows and columns** represent the **states**.
- Each **cell** at the intersection of a row and a column tells you if there are **flights between those two states**.

In our case a graph an its associated adjacency matrix will be something like:

You can easily match the graph to the matrix. For instance, states **A and B are connected**, their **mean flight price is $100** and the **variation (standard deviation) is only $5**, so prices don’t fluctuate much on that route. In contrast, flights between **A and D** are both **expensive and highly variable**, so while you’ll usually pay more, there’s also a better chance of finding either a great bargain or a very pricey ticket.

Whenever you see a **“0”** in the matrix, it means there is **no direct flight between those two states** (for example, A to C). You’ll also notice little circles on A, B, and E along those are “self‑connections,” indicating that each state has **internal flights** (for example, flying within A), in the matrix **autoconnections lay always on the diagonal** (A to A, B to B, and so on).

Finally, the upper‑ (above the diagonal) and lower‑triangle (bellow the diagonal) of the matrix are mirror images because we’ve simplified things by assuming that prices from X to Y equal prices from Y to X.
