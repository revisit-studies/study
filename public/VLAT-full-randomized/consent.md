## Title of Research Study: Supporting Data Visualization Literacy
## Introduction
You are being asked to participate in a research study. Before you
              agree, however, you must be fully informed about the purpose of
              the study, the procedures to be followed, and any benefits, risks
              or discomfort that you may experience as a result of your
              participation. This form presents information about the study so
              that you may make a fully informed decision regarding your
              participation.

## Purpose of the Study
Visual representations of data (visualizations) are increasingly
common in everyday life. The purpose of this study is to learn
more about how people read and understand visualizations.

## Tasks
The test contains 53 multiple-choice questions about 12 data
visualizations. 
It will take approximately 40 minutes to finish this
test.
For each question, you will be given a static data
visualization (right) and a problem to solve (left). 
If you don't know the answer, select
'skip'. We suggest maximizing your browser window as some charts can be on the larger side.

## Risks to study participants
Each participant in this study is assigned a random ID for analyses. As such,
your participation will remain anonymous and your responses will
not be used to identify you.

## Benefits to research participants and others:
The possible benefits include exposure to interesting data
visualization, along with helping inform the
development of future experiment reporting techniques.

## Record keeping and confidentiality
Records of your participation in this study will be held
confidential so far as permitted by law. However, the study
investigators, the sponsor or its designee and, under certain
circumstances, the Worcester Polytechnic Institute Institutional
Review Board (WPI IRB) will be able to inspect and have access to
this data. Any publication or presentation of the data will not
identify you.
