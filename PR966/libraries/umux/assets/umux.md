## UMUX

The evaluation you're about to complete is the Usability Metric for User Experience (UMUX). The UMUX is a short, standardized usability questionnaire developed as a concise and conceptually similar alternative to the System Usability Scale (SUS). It includes four statements designed to assess how effective, efficient, and satisfying you find the system to use.
