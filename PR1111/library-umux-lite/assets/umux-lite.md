This is a demo of the library `umux-lite`.

The UMUX-Lite is a two-item questionnaire derived from the original UMUX. It is designed for situations where testing time is limited, offering a brief yet reliable measure of perceived usability. The two statements assess how usable and easy to use you find the system, providing a quick indication of overall user experience quality.
