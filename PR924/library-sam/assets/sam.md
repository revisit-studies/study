This is an example study of the library `sam`.

The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) is a non-verbal pictorial assessment technique that directly measures the pleasure, arousal, and dominance associated with a person's affective reaction to a wide variety of stimuli. This library includes three components, one for each individual dimension, as well as a sequence containing all dimensions.
