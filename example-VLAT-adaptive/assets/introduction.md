# Adaptive Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (A-VLAT)

The Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT) is an assessment that measures peoples' ability to read, understand, and use data visualizations to solve problems.
Originally developed by Lee et al [Link](https://www.bckwon.com/pdf/vlat.pdf), it contains 52 multiple-choice questions and 12 data visualizations.

This is an adaptive version of VLAT, developed by [Cui et al.-- A-VLAT](https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/files/2023-adaptive.pdf).

In the test you will take, each subsequent question is selected based on the test-taker's performance. In this case, only 27 questions are needed to achieve similar measurement precision as the full-length original VLAT.

The questions will begin on the next screen. At the end, you will see a summary page where you can review what you got right / wrong.
