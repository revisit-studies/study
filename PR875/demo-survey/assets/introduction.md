# Introduction

Welcome to our study. This is an example study designed to demonstrate how to embed various question types and form elements within the study page. The types included in this study are [dropdown](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/DropdownResponse/), [numerical](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/NumericalResponse/), [Likert](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/LikertResponse/), [matrix](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/MatrixResponse/), [short text](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/ShortTextResponse/), [long text](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/LongTextResponse/), [checkbox](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/CheckboxResponse/), [radio](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/RadioResponse/), [slider](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/SliderResponse/), [ranking widget](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/RankingResponse/) and [buttons](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/ButtonsResponse/).

You'll also see how to randomize the order of options within a question, as well as the order of questions within a form.

Make sure to review [the documentation for BaseResponse](https://revisit.dev/docs/typedoc/interfaces/BaseResponse/).
